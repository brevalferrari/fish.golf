                Hello there! Welcome to my website.
                <br />
                This subdomain is where I have my portfolio which displays
                some of my favorite works.
                <br />
                (This is where I try to give them some more value than how
                much I actually think they have.)

                I love art, I think life would be way less meaningful
                without it. I also love science and I'm kinda good at
                computer science.
                <br />
                Because of that, I like to mess around with the two.
            </p>
            <p>I have four interests regarding this subject&nbsp;:</p>

            <p>
                I'v been playing the piano since I was ~8. I played in 4 orchestras and sang in 6 choirs.
                <br />
                Here's an old video from the music conservatory I was in
                featuring my friend Melvyn&nbsp;:

                I used to make poems as a kid. Here's one I made recently

                        Ci-gît là-bas la mer ; au-dessus la paroi du ciel
                        repose lourdement.<br />
                        Une brise s’en échappe et s’échoue sur la roche.

                        Il réfléchit, mais il est épuisé et le sommeil le
                        prend par surprise.<br />
                        Alors il se met à rêver.

                    <p>
                        Son esprit divague mais sur son corps une larme
                        s’enfuit.<br />
                        Il est seul, il n’y a plus rien pour lui.

                        Le chat cède à la peur juste un instant mais il
                        parvient à se retrouver.<br />

                When I started living alone, I was quite happy to have a
                MIDI keyboard. I had fun making and mixing an album with all
                freely available plugins I found online.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of these tracks caught the attention of an art director
                whom I became friends with, Victorans. I'm now making music
                for his new stop motion series,

            <h2>The Hidden songs of Computers</h2>
            <p>That's a hell of a title isn't it. Allow me to explain.</p>
            <p>
                Sometimes we love music because of an alien logic that is
                pleasing to try and understand one's own way ;
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism#Twelve-tone_serialism">twelve-tone serialism</a>
                is the perfect example. I believe every song has some kind
                of structure or logic to it. If you reverse this theory,
                every audio form with some kind of structure or logic to it
                can be considered music and can even be pleasing to try and
                understand.

                Computers are full of logic. So they're full of music. All
                they need is to be able to sing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I like Frankenstein. I like to play in the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>
                and I find this morbid curiosity fascinating. So as you may
                know already, computers communicate! They send themselves
                packets of information over the wire. Just like humans do
                over the air. So what would it be like to hear them?
            </p>
            <p>
                Turns out, it was pretty easy to do as you can guess from
                the relatively small size of
                <a href="https://github.com/brevalferrari/scapy-music/blob/main/realtime.py">the script I came up
                    with</a>. If you have Python and Wireshark / libpcap support via
                Npcap, it might just work on your computer. I'll try to
                upload a video when I get it working on a Windows machine as
                I could not make it work on Linux as of writing this
                paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could however bring back to life this old script that
                changes the color of my RGB keyboard instead&nbsp;:
            </p>
            <p>
                I also made the same thing about hearing keyboard input this
                time.
                <a href="https://github.com/brevalferrari/spybeep">Spybeep</a>
                turns your keyboard into a synth keyboard but keeps its
                functionality. Do not type passwords with it! If you have
                <a href="https://rustup.rs">Rust</a>, you can install it
                with "cargo install spybeep".
            </p>
            <p>
                Talking about turning events into sound, why not turn any
                data into sound as well? I made a tool called
                <a href="https://codeberg.org/p6nj/playthis">playthis</a>
                which will play anything you have to offer as raw audio.
                This process is called
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Databending">Databending</a>. I'm currently working on
                <a href="https://gitdab.com/breval/bent">Bent</a>, a project
                aiming to build a user-friendly tool to bend anything into
                anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, I fiddled with SVG paths, a system that builds
                SVG elements out of
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Paths">a small
                    language</a>. I did an artistic toy named GraphExpr that builds
                parametric graphs. You can visit the online version
                <a href="https://graph.fish.golf/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have a dead project called
                <a href="https://git.disroot.org/breval/Gyromin">Gyromin</a>
                which is supposed to be an Android app that turns your phone
                into a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin</a>
                powered by the phone's gyroscope. Android development is a
                pain but maybe one day I'll get back to it.

                Computer assisted music production started from the 50's to the 70's and got popular when computers
                became cheaper and more powerful. A lot of new tools gave us new ways of making music. As any tool, they
                also shaped the art we made with it in many ways. For example, most Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)
                use "patterns" and allow to easily compose a song with drag-and-drop loops. This made our music easily
                more repetitive and contributed to completely new genres. A lot of electronic dance genres would
                probably not exist without this technique which was inspired by common artistic repetition techniques
                used across all modern history.

                Today, the diversity and availability of these tools seems more than ever linked to the diversity of our
                art styles because we can achieve so much more with a computer that we rely a lot on these tools. So by
                contributing to the world of computer assisted music production tools, we directly contribute to our
                artistic diversity.

                My first steps into this rabbit hole started when I found <a
                    href="http://hiromorozumi.com/beepcomp/">BeepComp</a>, an editor for a custom <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language">MML</a> variant. I
                became fascinated by the software but even more by this new way of thinking about music. Languages all
                have their own logic and constraints. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> for example
                comes with a language that is very precise but almost impossible to write by hand (it's made of bytes)
                and the standard implies a specific bank of pre-generated sounds and natively only works with a standard
                set of 12 notes.
            </p>
            <p>When I started making languages for this purpose, I had so many ideas!</p>

                The first thing I wanted to try out is to remove the most constraints I could while still keeping my
                languages simple. I called my first project <a href="https://github.com/brevalferrari/Blip">Blip</a> ; I
                already could have variably-sized octaves with equal temperaments and when I heard it sounds weird and
                discovered the difference with the usual equal temperament we use today, it got me interested in
                xenharmonics. Meanwhile, I was thinking about how language layout impacts its identity and its usage (<a
                    href="https://github.com/brevalferrari/MML-XML-fusion">research repository</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                I first came up with <a href="https://github.com/brevalferrari/lov">LOV</a> (Lengh, Octave, Velocity),
                an editor for an MML-like language. You can download a zipped EXE <a
                    href="https://github.com/brevalferrari/LOV/releases/download/v0.1/LOV.IDE.zip">here</a>. After that,
                I decided that MIDI was too restrictive and implemented a variably-sized octave system in Rust and made
                another language and interpreter, <a
                    href="https://github.com/brevalferrari/bleeperpreter">Bleeperpreter</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Bleeperpreter introduced a new way of using instruments : instead of choosing from a list or having to
                bring a soundfount or samples on the table, you can now make your own instrument. BeepComp used sine,
                square and triangle waves but you can write them because these are signals with an underlying
                mathematical expression. Instead of hard-coding expressions, you write them yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bleeperpreter also had some design flaws. Elapsed time could not be kept between notes and because time
                is part of any signal expression, there was a slight crack between every note. Also, it did not solve an
                issue that was already present in BeepComp : how do you deal with crescendos or rituendos? There is no
                "slopes" to linearly change these parametters.
            </p>
            <p>
                So BLIP was <a href="https://gitdab.com/breval/blip">(re)born</a>. I made yet another language that's
                completely agnostic on music theory standards.
                Although there is an equivalent to notes (to which you give your own note names), you decide if octaves
                are real by binding a variable for it while calling the interpreter and using this variable in the
                instrument signal expression. Time also has standards in music theory (from note lengths to tempi) and
                because of that the interpreter needs another expression for note lengths. To solve the "slope" issue,
                the language allows you to smoothly change variables values by mutating them each frame / sample. These
                variables can then be bound to anything : note frequencies, note lengths, signal amplitude (volume)...

                $v-4.1      as soon as the variable mutation string stops being valid, usual sheet music parsing continues (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_munch)
loops:          (...)
                (2...)      to loop 2 times
                (n...)      to loop n times (taking the integer part with the floor function)
tuplet:         [...]       all inner note lengths are shrinked evenly so that the duration of the whole tuplet is the duration of a single note
slope:          {name...}   as soon as the name stops matching any known slope name, usual sheet music parsing continues (implementation details will surely mean stopping on the first match to prevent weird errors when two slope names start the same)
silence:        .           silence is music

                Thus, I know have a simple language with very little constrains. I still need to do some documentation
                and tutorials and I'm sure toying with it will bring me more ideas. I hope one day my languages will
                help other musicians and maybe bring new colors to the world of computer music.
